A puppet-lint plugin to check for undef in function calls.

## Installing

### From the command line

```shell
$ gem install puppet-lint-undef_in_function-check
```

### In a Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'puppet-lint-undef_in_function-check', :require => false
```

## Checks

### Undef passed to a function

When functions are called, `undef` is cast into an empty string. Passing `undef` to a function is most likely not what you mean to do.


#### What you have done

```puppet
somefunction(undef)
```

#### What you should have done

```puppet
somefunction('')
```


#### Disabling the check

To disable this check, you can add `--no-undef_in_function_assignment-check` to your puppet-lint command line.

```shell
$ puppet-lint --no-undef_in_function_assignment-check path/to/file.pp
```

Alternatively, if youâ€™re calling puppet-lint via the Rake task, you should insert the following line to your `Rakefile`.

```ruby
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_undef_in_function_assignment')
```
